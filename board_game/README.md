# Board Games JavaScript Example

This project demonstrates various fundamental JavaScript concepts through the context of board games. It covers how to work with objects and arrays, including getting, setting, and deleting properties, manipulating arrays, and splitting strings into arrays.

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Declaring an Object
- **Description**: Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs.
- **Example**: Creating board game objects with properties like `title`, `players`, `playTime`, `genre`, and `publisher`.

### 2. Getting Properties from an Object
- **Description**: Accessing the values of object properties using dot or bracket notation.
- **Example**: Retrieving the title, number of players, and play time from the board game objects.

### 3. Setting and Deleting Properties
- **Description**: Modifying existing properties, adding new ones, or removing properties from an object.
- **Example**: Changing the genre of a game, adding an expansions property, and deleting the publisher property.

### 4. Declaring an Array Literal
- **Description**: Arrays are ordered collections of values.
- **Example**: Creating an array to store the titles of board games in the collection.

### 5. Accessing Elements in an Array
- **Description**: Retrieving values from an array using their index.
- **Example**: Accessing the title of the second board game in the collection.

### 6. Setting Elements in an Array
- **Description**: Modifying the values in an array by their index.
- **Example**: Changing a board game title in the collection.

### 7. Working with Array Lengths
- **Description**: The `length` property gives the number of elements in an array.
- **Example**: Determining the number of board games in the collection.

### 8. Splitting a String into an Array
- **Description**: Converting a string into an array of substrings using a delimiter.
- **Example**: Splitting a descriptive string about a game into individual words.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/board-games-js-example.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd board-games-js-example
Open the Project: Open index.html in your favorite browser or open the .js file in a code editor like VS Code to see the code in action.

Run the Code: Run the JavaScript code in your browser's console or embed it in an HTML file to see the output.

Example Output
The script will output details about the board games, their properties, and how these properties are manipulated. You will see:

The properties of each game before and after modifications.
The board game collection array before and after an update.
The length of the array.
The array of words derived from a game description.
